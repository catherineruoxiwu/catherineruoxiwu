## Welcome, welcome 😉
I am Catherine 吴若菥 from [Nanjing, China](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%B1%9F%E8%8B%8F%E7%9C%81%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%B8%82/@17.5126382,77.2950694,3z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x35b58c9b668dcd83:0x8ffbb60b79df1b06!8m2!3d32.0583799!4d118.79647).

- ✨ I am passionate about building things that generate positive impacts. (Yea, I know it sounds cliché, but it is exactly the reason why I want to pursue a career in software engineering.)

- 🔭 I am currently working on a very cool project. Hopefully, it will be released in June. 
 
- 💻 I had prior experiences in Android and fullstack website development. Feel free to contact me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-ruoxi-w-7b46ab183/) and [email](mailto:ruoxi.wu@uwaterloo.ca)! I am open to project collaborations and fullstack development internship opporunities.
