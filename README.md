## Welcome, welcome ~
I am Catherine 吴若菥 originally from [Nanjing, China](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%B1%9F%E8%8B%8F%E7%9C%81%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%B8%82/@17.5126382,77.2950694,3z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x35b58c9b668dcd83:0x8ffbb60b79df1b06!8m2!3d32.0583799!4d118.79647).
- 👩🏻‍💻 I had prior [experiences](https://github.com/catherineruoxiwu/catherineruoxiwu/blob/main/Catherine_Wu_Resume_v6-4-1.pdf) in fullstack website, mobile, and desktop application development. My expertise is in implementing human-centric user interfaces and experieces.
- 👾 Two of my passions in CS are **human-computer interaction** and **distributed systems**. I enjoy exploring new design spaces with AR/VR devices as well as the intersection of HCI and AI. I am also curious about the infrastructure of almost every software.
- 👀 I am actively looking for **full time SWE opportunities for 2025**.
